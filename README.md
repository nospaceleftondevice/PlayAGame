# PlayAGame

Oasis Bloom Hackathon submission May 12, 2022

## Inspiration

As a kid in the eighties I enjoyed playing video games.  The problem was for some games I neither had the skills nor large swaths of time to advance my game play.   I wish there was a way to advance in games sans the large time commitment.

## What it does

With the **Play A Game Marketplace**, you can buy or rent NTF game tokens to unlock levels in your games.  If you are very skillful, you can bundle up your game achievements and sell, or rent them out to other players.

## How we built it

Using various open source tooling and the Oasis suite of blockchain technologies, we have put together a working proof of concept to demonstrate a NFT marketplace with a playable browser based game.

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge is making the marketplace secure so that NTF's can't be pirated.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We integrated Parcel as the secure storage backend to keep the _Game Tokens_ secure.  We have created the foundation for game developers to use the system in an open and non-proprietary manner.

## What we learned

We learned a bunch about Parcel, Emerald, React, and other various frameworks.

## What's next for Play A Game

When looking at the **Compute** capabilities of the OASIS platform, our future goal is to extend and enhance Parcel's computation framework by enabling GPU based work loads (think cloud gaming!!).
